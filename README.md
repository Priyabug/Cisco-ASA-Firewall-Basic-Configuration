# Cisco-ASA-Firewall-Basic-Configuration

## ⚙️ Technologies Implemented

This project showcases a range of essential networking technologies and configurations using Cisco equipment in a simulated environment.

---

### 🧩 Network Infrastructure

- 🛠️ **Creating a Simple Network**  
  Built a basic topology using a **Cisco Router** and an **Access Layer Switch**.

- 🔌 **Correct Cabling**  
  Connected routers, switches, and host devices using **appropriate cable types** (straight-through and crossover).

---

### 🧱 Layer 2 Configurations

- 🏷️ **VLAN Creation & Port Assignment**  
  Defined multiple **VLANs** and assigned switch ports to specific VLAN IDs to isolate departmental traffic.

- 🧮 **Subnetting & IP Addressing**  
  Subnetted the IP network to align with VLAN requirements and assigned **logical IP schemes**.

---

### 🌐 Layer 3 Configurations

- 🔁 **Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)**  
  Configured **sub-interfaces** on a single router interface to enable communication between VLANs.

- 📡 **DHCP Configuration**  
  Implemented a **DHCP server on the router** to provide automatic IP addressing to host devices.

---

### 📶 Wireless Networking

- 📲 **WLAN Setup (Cisco Access Point)**  
  Configured **wireless access** for each department using a Cisco Access Point for mobile connectivity.

---

### 🖥️ Host & Network Testing

- 🧾 **Static & Dynamic Host Configurations**  
  Configured host devices using both **static IPs** and **DHCP assignments**.

- ✅ **Testing & Verification**  
  Verified end-to-end connectivity using tools like `ping` and **simulation mode** in Packet Tracer.
